# alu-AirBnB_clone

The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the:[the AirBnB clone.](https://intranet.aluswe.com/rltoken/FrRTcvuF5L9wWDzFE9k01A).

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed of:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic

- A database or files that store data (data = objects)

- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).

## The Final Product

The AirBnB Clone Project
Project Description
This project will integrate the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we will work on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in _python_ . We will then integrate Data(python objects) that are generated and store them in a _JSON file_ with the help of json module in python

Description of the command interpreter:
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the _Web App_ where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are: 1. Show 2. Create 3. Update 4. Destroy/ Delete 5. Count/ List

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the following actions can be performed: 1. Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new place) 2. Retrieving an object from file, a database etc ... 3. Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc) 4. Updating an object in the file, a database etc ... 5. Deleting an object in the file, a database etc ...

How to start it
The following instructions will be the guidelines to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (Linux distributions) for development and testing purposes.

Installing
First you will need to clone the repository of the project from Github. This will contain the simple shell program and all of its dependancies
